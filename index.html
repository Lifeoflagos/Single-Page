            I am a self-employed web developer specializing in the WordPress platform. My main area of work is WordPress
            Customizing from full site setup and theme customization to various tweaks. I do plain HTML coding for
            complex content blocks that can't be realized with theme shortcodes, CSS edits, PHP code changes for
            existing and new page/post templates.
            I like my job very much and I do it with love.
